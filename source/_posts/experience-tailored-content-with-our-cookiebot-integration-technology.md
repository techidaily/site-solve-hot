## ABBYY’s New Brand Reflects Its Focus on People and Business Transformation

March 18, 2021

[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a global Digital Intelligence company, revealed today its new corporate brand identity, featuring vibrant illustrations and colors and an updated logo. The new brand design, created with brand and design agency, [Shuka](https://shuka.design/), reflects what ABBYY represents: a visionary, innovative, trusted, high-energy, and creative expert who helps to reimagine and accelerate organizations’ transformations globally.

“After announcing our new [Digital Intelligence](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) portfolio last year and identifying new market positioning and brand personality, we wanted to evolve our look-and-feel that brings this new vision to life and clearly communicates these key brand attributes,” said Scott Opitz, CMO at ABBYY. “We were inspired by our customers through a series of interviews and decided to take a fresh look at our corporate brand. The new ABBYY look translates to how we invite customers, partners, and employees to experience and engage with us, to transform and reimagine. It now personifies who ABBYY is.”

The redesign preserves and refreshes the brand’s legacy. ABBYY is an established company recognized for its technology acumen, but as the company has evolved and offers more comprehensive solutions for higher value use cases, the new brand identity evokes this transformation. One main graphic includes an unfolding shape that goes from one design to another and symbolizes transformation, the turning point and start of a new future. The logo is both timeless and modern, with a classic font and a new, vibrant red color. The new color schemes are fresh, energetic, and modern and the gradients represent the transformation. 

In acknowledgment of ABBYY’s evolving engagement with people to transform the way they work and help them thrive, the new design reflects the company’s goal to deeply connect with customers’ motivations. Customers and prospects will see connections to who ABBYY is in the designs—fresh and exciting, professional yet fun, and personal.

The rise of digital transformation has ushered in a new era for ABBYY. The company aspires to constantly reimagine how technology solves process and data challenges to help people and organizations thrive. The Digital Intelligence strategy and ambition builds upon a strong foundation of success and limitless innovation. With Digital Intelligence, ABBYY aims to take the leading market position and continue to help people imagine a better way to work and accelerate business.

The rebrand will be showcased live during the ABBYY Reimagine virtual conference. Visit [ABBYY's Media & Brand Center](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) to view the company’s new look.
