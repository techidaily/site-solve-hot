Senior executives from PwC and Dell presented best practices for deploying RPA with content intelligence for frictionless purchase order processing and extracting data from multiple semi-structured and unstructured documents.

They left the ABBYY Technology Summit with examples from global customers and partners on how they can achieve more intelligence from their content, processes, organization and customers.”
