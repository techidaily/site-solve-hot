#### _The server-based OCR service joins the FineReader product family to consolidate ABBYY’s top-of-the-line document capture and PDF conversion products and solutions under one umbrella._

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/)ABBYY®, a global provider of content intelligence solutions and services, today announced the rebranding of its most powerful server-based optical character recognition service ABBYY Recognition Server as ABBYY FineReader Server. The step aims to further consolidate all ABBYY OCR and PDF conversion offering under the FineReader brand making it easier for customers and partners to find a suitable solution in the company’s comprehensive product portfolio.

The renamed service also received a major performance and functionality update. The new version, ABBYY FineReader Server 14, is powered by the next generation of ABBYY’s intelligent OCR technology, offers improved barcode recognition and native 64-bit support. The API improvements and access to servers installed in remote locations, including Microsoft Azure, add to accessibility and scalability. The updated service also supports new PDF standards such as PDF/UA and smart detection of PDF quality. Furthermore, FineReader Server’s operator station now has a completely re-designed, intuitive interface empowering all users to start conversion processes, no special training needed. The newly added text redaction, indexation, and document assembly tools allow for more flexibility in document-related workflows.

“This rebranding is part of our coordinated effort to make ABBYY’s expansive product portfolio easier to navigate for our clients and partners. FineReader Server perfectly complements the FineReader product family, which includes our market-leading OCR and PDF conversion solutions for businesses and individuals. The rebranding comes hand-in-hand with a major product update designed to significantly accelerate and simplify core business processes such as digitization of documents for further processing with eDiscovery and digital forensics systems; long-term document storage and compliance; integration with SharePoint and many more,” comments Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at ABBYY.

ABBYY FineReader Server is a server-based intelligent OCR service for automated document capture and PDF conversion. Designed for high-volume conversion, ABBYY FineReader Server automatically converts large collections of documents into searchable, shareable digital libraries. The service converts scanned and electronic documents into PDF, PDF/A, Microsoft Word, or other formats for search, long-term retention, collaboration, or additional processing – quickly, accurately, and automatically.

ABBYY FineReader Server allows organizations to make information accessible, searchable and normalized (standardized). The service helps businesses, BPOs and system integrators to optimize business processes while achieving compliance, collaboration and long-term archiving goals. It allows establishing cost-efficient processes for converting paper, image or electronic documents into PDF files suitable for search, long-term preservation or further processing. Quick deployment, easy administration and automated work routines further accelerate FineReader Server’s return-on-investment.
