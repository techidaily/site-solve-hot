Finally, smartphones have crossed their tipping point. For some time now, their ubiquity has been fueling a rage in apps for both iPhone and Android platforms. A business is no longer called “smart” unless it is actively building a mobile future. And everywhere you look, smart people are embracing the world of mobile. Do you have a tricky task to pull off? Oh yea, there’s an app for that! With the mobile app market expected to reach over [$100 billion in 2020](https://www.businessinsider.com/big-data-is-the-key-to-the-app-market-reaching-100-billion-in-2020-2016-5?IR=T), businesses are investing in mobile apps to better engage with their customers and improve their experience.

## TextGrabber

One of the coolest things about travelling is that it encourages understanding and appreciation of people and places far away from home. Yet, it can be difficult to remain enthusiastic about your travels when every contact with foreign words and phrases turn your adventure into a never-ending road trip with countless dead ends. [TextGrabber](https://www.textgrabber.pro/en/) was designed specifically to help professionals stay in touch and to keep track of key documents, manage their time and make sure they are up to date on key client info in between travels. With the latest updates, TextGrabber has become a Swiss-army knife for road warriors and avid travelers looking to stay organized and travel efficiently. The app allows users to digitize and translate virtually any text - from books and manuals to ads, road signs and even text on a computer or TV screen using their smartphones.

Powered by a Point&Capture technology, TextGrabber can instantly capture text from live video stream or photo, turning the result into clickable format like links, phone numbers, email addresses, street addresses, times and dates. Users can follow, call, email, find on maps and create events using the links. Another awesome feature that comes with TG is Real-Time Translation directly on the camera screen without taking photos. The app recognizes and translate text into 100+ languages online (full-text translation) and 10 languages offline (word-by-word translation). An added bonus is the QR code reader mode which allows you to easily scan QR codes and the History feature, which you can use to all your results.

It happens to me all the time and that is why [Business Card Reader](https://www.abbyybcr.com/en/) is a saving grace both in business and personal life. Of course, carrying around a Rolodex or looking back on cardholders can be deeply rewarding, but it’s a super weird habit to keep in the digital era. Instead, why not use your smartphone to scan and manage all your business cards and contacts in a flash. BCR helps keep your entire network and professional contacts at your fingertips anytime anywhere. The app automatically saves all the data to your contact list, which means you can now call or email any of your contacts in a matter of seconds.

All contacts are stored in a cloud and synchronized across your devices, allowing access from your smartphone, tablet or computer.
