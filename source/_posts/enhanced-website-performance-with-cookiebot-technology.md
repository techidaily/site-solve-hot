ABBYY is known for its extensive expertise in structured and semi-structured document classification and extraction and continues to extend its customer deals further into unstructured documents.

IDC MarketScape

In an increasingly crowded IDP vendor landscape, ABBYY stands out for its 30 years of experience in the market, large IDP customer base, competitive pricing, and its online marketplace offering over 150 pre-trained document models.

ABBYY often offers customers multiple approaches/options to address an IDP use case. This choice allows customers to build solutions based on their requirements (e.g., speed, cost, accuracy/precision) rather than utilizing a single approach that will be applied universally across all customer use cases.
