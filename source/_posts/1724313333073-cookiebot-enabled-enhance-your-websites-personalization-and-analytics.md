_Programs Educate Organizations on How Using AI Can Accelerate Better Business Outcomes_

Industry leaders in intelligent automation are joining forces to dedicate September as [Intelligent Automation Month](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). Programs will highlight the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) with automation on businesses across the globe – changing the way individuals work, and how companies can achieve operational efficiency and customer excellence.

The month-long initiative will include curated content spanning digital events, new research, and other resources to educate business and technology leaders on the benefits of intelligent automation (IA). The digital assets will provide accessible and digestible insight on the key technologies in the ecosystems including intelligent document processing (IDP), robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), and process intelligence (PI).

ABBYY is leading the initiative and has created a series of digital events that will be launched weekly throughout September. Each webinar will provide up-to-date insights, trends, and best practices and use cases from industry leaders for attendees to take what they learn and put their information to work. Business leaders and journalists are encouraged to participate in the following sessions to gain firsthand insight into overcoming common business challenges and achieving success:

* **Sept. 7: ABBYY Customer Connect** – _exclusively for ABBYY customers and partners_  
    
 From generative AI to language learning models, learn how to leverage the latest AI within the ABBYY platform and expand IDP across the organization.
* **Sept. 14: Start Your Journey Smarter** – _featuring Doculabs_  
    
 Learn how to prioritize processes that will yield the greatest benefits, prevent implementation surprises, and generate the most value from your investment.
* **Sept. 21: Make the Business Case for Intelligent Automation** – _featuring ISG_  
    
 Understand the impact today’s economy is having on IT budgets, learn how to build a business case, be watchful of common hurdles during adoption, and measure ROI.
* **Sept. 28: Panel with innovation leaders** – _featuring TransUnion and other influencers_  
    
 Hear lessons learned from leaders who spearheaded transformative change at their organizations.

Intelligent Automation Month will also feature perspectives by industry advocates including MCCi, Pipefy, Reveal Group, and FormTran exploring uses of intelligent automation across government, healthcare, and other verticals.

"The intelligent automation ecosystem is brimming with forward-thinking innovators who help businesses work smarter and provide more impactful customer experiences.   
We felt it was important to help businesses cut through the hype and hear first-hand how we collectively are combining experience and innovation to enable maximum ROI on IT initiatives. We’re excited to spearhead Intelligent Automation Month in collaboration with other automation leaders who are elevating enterprises to the next level of operational efficiency."

_Gabrielle Lukianchuk, Chief Marketing Officer_
