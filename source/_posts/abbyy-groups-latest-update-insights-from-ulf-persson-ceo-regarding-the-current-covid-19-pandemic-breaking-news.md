The last few weeks have brought unprecedented developments to our communities and the world at large. Like many companies across the globe, one of the measures ABBYY decided to implement is remote work for all employees. Rest assured that ABBYY is running business as usual. We’re well-equipped to work remotely and are still accessible through all normal channels of communication. Our technical support, customer service, professional services, and other teams you rely on every day remain available to prevent any interruption to our normal operations.

To ensure we maintain these high levels of service,ABBYY is closely following the advice and guidelines of the World Health Organization and local agencies and has implemented a strict travel policy for our employees to minimize in-person meetings with customers and partners. Instead, we’re using technology to maintain strong communications using virtual platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams. We also remain readily accessible via traditional online methods and phone.

We believe it is more important than ever that businesses have what it takes to make timely, intelligent decisions. There’s a lot of data coming in, and it can be overwhelming, especially right now. We will continue to monitor the news and directives as they develop and adjust our plans accordingly to ensure that we are prepared to assist you as our business partners.

These are testing times for individuals and families, companies, and organizations. We all need to focus on supporting those in need and help decrease the spread of the virus. At the same time, we need to show resilience and try to get on with our lives and jobs as best we can.

Ulf Persson  
CEO, ABBYY Group
