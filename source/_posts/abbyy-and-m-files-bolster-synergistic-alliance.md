#### _New ABBYY integrations bolster AI-powered intelligent information management solutions for joint customers_

  
ABBYY, a global leader in enterprise content IQ, has announced a strengthened technology alliance with [M-Files](https://www.m-files.com/en "M-Files"), the intelligent information management company, that will boost AI-driven document management offerings for shared customers.

ABBYY has become an M-Files Certified Application Partner (CAP) following the release of its [FlexiCapture Connector for M-Files](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). The connector seamlessly integrates ABBYY's intelligent data extraction and recognition capabilities with M-Files intelligent information management solution to fully automate end-to-end business solutions, like [accounts payable invoice automation](https://catalog.m-files.com/shop/abbyy-flexicapture-for-invoices/). The CAP program recognizes partners who have received certification and provides support and assistance to develop and market business applications leveraging the M-Files intelligent information management platform.

“Our enhanced partnership with M-Files is further evidence of the growing need for intelligent document processing solutions that enable business agility and support strategic digital transformation initiatives in enterprises," commented Bruce Orcutt, senior vice president of product marketing at ABBYY. "We are honored to be recognized as a M-Files Certified Application Partner and look forward to an effective and long-term collaboration for the benefit of our joint customers.”

The strengthened alliance also makes it easier to integrate ABBYY's Capture-as-a-Service functionality into M-Files, enabling users to take advantage of their classification, extraction, and transformation services at any point in a document's lifecycle.

“We are proud of the continued expansion of our fast growing partnership with ABBYY, allowing us to enhance M-Files AI-driven solutions and services to improve business processes and customer experience," said Michael Tanner, vice president of strategy and corporate development at M-Files. "Our close collaboration with ABBYY provides a renewed impetus to further leverage ABBYY's best in breed solution for AI-driven intelligent document processing in our innovative intelligent information management platform."

Additionally, M-Files will be able to leverage ABBYY’s Text Analytics for Contracts, a SaaS platform providing contract discovery and analytics in its Intelligent Information Management platform. ABBYY Text Analytics for Contracts integrates ABBYY’s powerful recognition, advanced linguistics, data capture and natural language processing capabilities to automatically identify and extract business intelligence from contracts and leases and speed up content migration and [compliance](https://go.m-files.com/ondemand-webinar-registration-M-Files-ABBYY-can-address-GDPR-compliance-obligations.html).

“The partnership between ABBYY and M-Files has allowed us to leverage the respective technologies to streamline our invoice processes and better serve our suppliers.” said Angela Costa, transactional services manager, Probuild, a joint customer. “We use the ABBYY and M-Files solution to process thousands of invoices monthly and have been able to substantially reduce operating expenses, shorten processing times and facilitate user friendly search and retrieval of invoice documents.”
