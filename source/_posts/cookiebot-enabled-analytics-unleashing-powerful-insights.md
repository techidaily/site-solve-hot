Scott Opitz has been appointed Chief Technology and Product Officer (CTO and CPO) at intelligent automation company, ABBYY. He is charged with overseeing a massive 40% increase, in research and development (R&D) investment in 2022\. Opitz’s responsibilities include leading the strategy, development, and execution of the company’s product and innovation efforts based in Europe and the US, solidifying the company’s commitment to continuous enhancement of its market-leading [intelligent document processing](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) (IDP) platform [Vantage](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) and [process intelligence](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) solution [Timeline](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/).

ABBYY has developed proprietary technologies for decades and its suite of intelligent process automation (IPA) solutions have continuously taken leadership positions in independent analyst assessments of the leading analyst firms. All named ABBYY as a leader in IDP and/or process intelligence, positioning the company as the best-in-breed provider to capture a significant share of the IPA market that will grow to reach $42.4 billion by 2025 \[1\].

“During the time Scott has been with ABBYY, he has been instrumental in elevating ABBYY’s value proposition to address enterprise leaders’ challenges and needs,” commented Ulf Persson, CEO at ABBYY. “When we evaluated what the next phase of our product and development roadmaps required, we knew Scott’s technical expertise, knowledge of ABBYY, and leadership qualities would be best served in his new role as CPO and CTO. We are confident he will accelerate our time-to-market for our intelligent process automation solutions and give tough competition to the existing players in the rapidly growing market.” 

“I’m thrilled to get my hands back on product development, strategy and management,” commented Opitz. “I initially joined ABBYY by integrating process mining into the company’s core capabilities and now I’ll be expanding my role to drive all of ABBYY’s product roadmaps and executing them quickly. I look forward to working with the product and engineering teams to drive next generation intelligent automation solutions for ABBYY’s long-term growth.”

Opitz joined ABBYY with the [acquisition of TimelinePI](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) in 2019, of which he was co-founder, President, and CEO from its inception. A 30-year veteran in the technology industry, Opitz has a long-standing history of founding and building groundbreaking software companies in the application integration, business process management, and business intelligence spaces.

He has held numerous executive-level positions in technology and business development for public and private companies. Opitz is a named inventor of 13 patents and patent applications relating to process intelligence technologies. He resides in Pennsylvania.
