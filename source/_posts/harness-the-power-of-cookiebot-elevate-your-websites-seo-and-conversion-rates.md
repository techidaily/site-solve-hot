In another move to position the company for financial growth, [ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) has appointed **James Ritter** as its Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Ritter has more than 20 years of experience working for international services and software companies and has a strong background in accounting, financial controls, revenue recognition, financial management, operational improvement, and strategic development. Ritter will leverage his previous high growth software experiences as well as knowledge gained at Ernst & Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers to help ABBYY scale for growth and make continued investments in ABBYY’s market-leading intelligent automation solutions.

“We are thrilled to have James take on the role as Chief Financial Officer in what is a very exciting time at ABBYY. He will be instrumental in helping us drive our growth strategy,” said **Ulf Persson, Chief Executive Officer** at ABBYY. “ABBYY have always combined growth with profitability and we strongly believe in a sustainable business model based on serving our customers in the best possible way. James brings the knowledge, experience and passion needed to manage for growth as well as financial strength. He has already proven to be an incredible asset to our leadership team, and we’re just getting started.”

Ritter commented, “ABBYY is well positioned to deliver next generation, no code automation solutions that are changing the way companies around the world do business, and it is an incredible opportunity to serve as CFO during a period of such extraordinary growth and opportunity for the company. I look forward to being part of an amazing leadership team taking ABBYY to its next level.”

Ritter has held several leadership positions with global organizations including WPP, Ferrovial, and BigCommerce. He originally joined ABBYY as VP of Finance in June 2021, and prior to joining ABBYY, was the VP Controller at Accruent, an international enterprise software organization. Ritter is a Certified Public Accountant with an accounting degree from Rowan University and is actively pursuing an MBA at Boston University Questrom School of Business. He resides in Texas.
