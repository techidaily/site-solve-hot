ABBYY, a global leader in intelligent document processing, today announced the release of ABBYY FineScanner AI, the next-generation mobile scanner for iOS and Android. The new AI-enabled functionality allows the user to instantly find photos of documents in the gallery and recognize the text in them without an Internet connection.

FineScanner AI saves valuable time and effort by eliminating manual search and scrolling. The app uses neural networks to instantly sort through the gallery and find images with text and photos of documents suitable for recognition. The new feature is available today on iOS and Android devices and works automatically when the user opens the gallery in the app. The shortcut is especially convenient for those who frequently take photos or save images to the gallery. Once the right scan is located, the user can optimize it for viewing and printing (crop, correct the perspective, apply filters, eliminate noise and boost contrast), recognize and edit the text, convert and share the document via email, messaging or cloud services.

FineScanner AI also received one of the most requested features – offline text recognition. Now Android and iOS users can recognize and edit the text in their scans without an Internet connection – ABBYY’s optical character recognition technology works locally on the device. Offline recognition is perfect for frequent travelers and those who work with sensitive and confidential documents. It does not preserve the document’s original layout, but offers superior security and speed. To preserve the layout or convert the document into a different format, an Internet connection is required. FineScanner’s online OCR technology allows to create a perfect digital copy with the original headers, graphs, images, and tables and convert it into 12 popular formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.). The technology works with 193 languages online and 63 offline.

“Today, in the mobile-first era, many administrative and document-related tasks have moved from PCs to our smartphones. However, according to [our recent survey](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), people still find mobile technologies too difficult to use when it comes to admin. This is an important pain point that negatively affects user experience and hinders automation in the workplace. We aim to change that with ABBYY FineScanner AI, an intelligent mobile assistant that automates scanning, editing, and conversion. By applying [ABBYY Mobile Capture](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) technologies and neural networks, we transform the experience of working with documents on a mobile device empowering the user to spend less time on paperwork and more time on social and creative activities,” comments Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at ABBYY.

FineScanner AI is a perfect companion for banking, sales, legal, medical, and consulting professionals. The world’s leading companies, including a Big Four consulting firm, leverage customized versions of the application to help their employees efficiently manage documentation and move towards a paperless office.
