_**Partnership to provide powerful integrated advance capture solutions available through resellers**_

ABBYY®, a leading provider of recognition, data capture and language-based text analytics technologies has joined the [Laserfiche](https://www.laserfiche.com/) Professional Developer Partnership (PDP) program to integrate its FlexiCapture software with [Laserfiche Enterprise Content Management (ECM) products](https://www.laserfiche.com/products/).

Bringing ABBYY’s advanced capture features such as classification, data extraction and validation as well as a higher level of automation for complex document types to Laserfiche’s ECM products, the [integration](https://www.laserfiche.com/marketplace/abbyy-flexicapture/) of the partners’ products will enable businesses of all sizes to modernize their operations, improve customer service and reduce operating costs.

ABBYY FlexiCapture is highly accurate and scalable document imaging and data extraction software that automatically transforms documents of any structure, language or content into usable and accessible business-ready data. Intelligent self-learning classification and recognition technologies enable FlexiCapture to replace error-prone manual processes with automatic document classification and processing.

Additionally, ABBYY’s capture configurations are optimized for specific business processes including:

* **ABBYY FlexiCapture for Invoices**, which enables the automatic capture, validation and processing of incoming invoices, aligning closely with accounts payable workflows developed with Laserfiche; and
* **ABBYY FlexiCapture for Mailrooms**, which delivers automatic document classification to support Laserfiche case management, contract management and human resource workflows.

“By automating resource-intensive tasks such as data entry, document separation and classification, ABBYY FlexiCapture enables faster transactions and more efficient operations,” said Bruce Orcutt, vice president, Product Marketing and Management, ABBYY NAHQ. “Integrating FlexiCapture with Laserfiche ECM will enable organizations in all industries to manage document-driven business processes more efficiently and productively, starting from the moment of capture.”

Through its [PDP program](https://www.laserfiche.com/pdp/), Laserfiche provides out-of-the-box integrations with leading systems for enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), geographic information system (GIS) as well as ECM-related solutions.

“Integrating ABBYY FlexiCapture software with Laserfiche ECM raises the bar for data accuracy and improved process efficiency,” said Catherine Ramos, director of the Professional Developer Partnership program at Laserfiche. “We’re delighted to partner with ABBYY to provide our customers with advanced capture optimized to support accounts payable, contract management and other high-value business processes.”

The first ABBYY-Laserfiche integrated products are expected to be in second quarter 2016, and sold through the Laserfiche global reseller channel.
