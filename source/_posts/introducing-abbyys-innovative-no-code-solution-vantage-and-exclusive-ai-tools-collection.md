_Vantage 2 delivers ready-to-use AI skills for intelligent automation. The ABBYY Marketplace allows users to try cognitive skills to accelerate their automation initiatives._ 

ABBYY, a Digital Intelligence company, announced today, during its [Reimagine](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) virtual conference, the launch of Vantage 2, a low-code/no-code platform that delivers cognitive skills for RPA robots, automation systems, chatbots, and mobile solutions, enabling organizations to gain insights from documents and content. The company also launched ABBYY Marketplace, the first open marketplace where organizations can discover, try, and purchase reusable AI skills to accelerate their automation initiatives, while partners can build and publish skills to automate all types of content-centric processes.

[Cognigy](https://www.cognigy.com/), [EXL](https://www.exlservice.com/), [Kryon](https://www.kryonsystems.com/), [Micro Focus](https://www.microfocus.com/), [NICE](https://www.nice.com/), [Pegasystems](https://www.pega.com/), [PwC](https://www.pwc.com/), and [RoboRana](https://roborana.be/) are already integrating Vantage 2 with their platforms. Out-of-the-box connectors developed by ABBYY are available for [Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/), [Blue Prism](https://www.blueprism.com/), and [UiPath](https://www.uipath.com/).

[ABBYY Vantage 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) empowers citizen developers to have more control within intelligent automation initiatives. The platform drives change across the entire organization by enabling business users to digitize operations faster without complete reliance on IT: with Vantage, they can derive critical insights from documents on a large scale. Through empowering individual users, Vantage allows business leaders to accelerate automation strategies, improve customer experience, lower risk, and increase productivity. The re-architectured platform is built on microservices and packaged into containers orchestrated by Kubernetes to fit the needs of agile IT operations. With a cloud-first architecture and intuitive, low-code/no-code interface, Vantage makes transformative technologies like AI and machine learning easy to adopt and consume within the enterprise.

The new [ABBYY Marketplace](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) provides an extensive online collection of reusable technology assets including cognitive skills for classification of documents and data extraction, ready-to-go process flows, and pre-built connectors. With more enterprises interested in the try-and-buy method, the Marketplace offers pre-trained skills for all types of documents like invoices, purchase orders, receipts, loan documents, insurance claims, bills of lading, and more. ABBYY partners also can contribute new skills and other technology assets to the Marketplace or utilize ready-to-deploy assets to speed up automation projects.

“According to IDC’s 2020 Intelligent Document Processing Use Cases Survey\[1\], almost half of enterprise leaders cite improved business decision making as a primary benefit of digitizing and transforming document processes; other benefits include customer and employee satisfaction and improved accountability. However, the respondents also mention the shortage of IT resources and inadequate worker skills among the main challenges of adopting IDP technologies. This highlights the need for modern low-code platforms that enable a wider range of business functions to contribute to transformation initiatives and accelerate deployments,” commented Holly Muscolino, Research Vice President, Content and Process Strategies and the Future of Work at IDC. “Vantage 2 and ABBYY Marketplace are well-positioned to provide an accessible solution for business analysts that can be used to build or purchase skills, make them discoverable to an automation platform, add them to a robotic workflow, and drive value for their organization.”

“We see a new kind of business user within enterprises today, looking for a faster way to consume and leverage data contained within documents. Their goals can be achieved through AI-enabled, easily consumable, ready-to-use technology we call skills,” added Bruce Orcutt, SVP Product Marketing at ABBYY. “Vantage 2 delivers a completely redesigned user experience that revolutionizes the way AI-enabled skills are created, trained, and published. The fast learning curve that comes with the platform makes it easy to apply the technology across many business functions and automation systems. Additionally, users will find many pre-trained skills in the ABBYY Marketplace that enable popular RPA tools, BPM systems, and conversational AI chatbots to understand the most complex documents. Vantage 2 and the Marketplace are designed to unlock opportunities for true business transformation.”

“As a Technology Alliance Partner, we’ve been working together solving several document processing challenges, most recently around the SBA PPP. ABBYY’s technology adds the critical skills necessary for understanding and processing content to Blue Prism Intelligent Automation. Vantage 2 is a great example of the democratization of AI, while the new out-of-the-box connectors will enable us to deliver value to customers faster,” commented Bruce Mazza, VP of the Technology Alliances Program at Blue Prism.

Vantage 2 allows business users to quickly get started with all types of high-value use cases that move the business forward, such as invoice processing, accounts receivable, claims processing, mortgage lending, and customer onboarding. The platform connects seamlessly with other intelligent automation platforms, like RPA or BPM, and line of business applications, including ERP systems. Vantage powers a new breed of software to understand and process documents in the same way that humans do. Its combination of pre-trained neural networks and online machine learning delivers the recognition of unstructured data, quickly adapting to changing input and generating an accurate, reliable result.

ABBYY Vantage 2 is available now to early adopter customers and partners. It can be purchased directly through ABBYY or via a global network of partners including RPA vendors, strategic system integrators, and consulting firms.
