_New mobile SDK with ABBYY OCR enables developers to create mobile apps that leverage text recognition directly on a smartphone camera preview screen._

ABBYY®, a leading provider of technologies and solutions to action information, today announced the release of the [ABBYY Real-Time Recognition SDK](http://rtrsdk.com), a software development kit enabling developers to create iOS and Android apps that eliminate photo taking and saving to capture information. The SDK is powered by ABBYY’s best-in-class optical character recognition (OCR) technology.

The Real-Time Recognition SDK is available worldwide, free of charge and includes support for 46 languages. The SDK’s ability to capture information without saving a photo allows a more seamless user experience. It decreases the time needed for common app transactions including the input of payment information or basic forms.

“We are proud to offer developers and independent software vendors the capability to recognize text on the fly,” says Bruce Orcutt, vice president of marketing at ABBYY North American Headquarters. “Our technology greatly improves the user experience and provides incredible recognition accuracy, which is a must for apps in industries such as banking, insurance and healthcare.”

The ABBYY Real-Time Recognition SDK is available for download at www.rtrsdk.com. Real-time translation functionality and support for additional recognition languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Cyrillic are available upon request.
