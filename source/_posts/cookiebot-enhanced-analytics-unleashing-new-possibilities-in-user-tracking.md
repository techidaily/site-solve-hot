The second annual [Intelligent Automation Month](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) takes place during September 2024 with online programs designed to help organizations from every industry understand the impact of purpose-built AI and how it can advance their business.

Weekly webinars will provide accessible and digestible information based on real-world applications, best practices, and current research that will help attendees know how to identify automation opportunities, navigate AI compliance and prepare for new regulations. Attendees will learn the benefits of key AI-powered intelligent automation technologies including process intelligence and intelligent document processing (IDP), including valuable input from customers, partners and technology influencers on how to strategically leverage AI and automation to maximize ROI.

Business and IT leaders and journalists are invited to join ABBYY in the following sessions to gain first-hand knowledge about overcoming common business challenges and achieving success with AI. These sessions will include industry experts alongside ABBYY leaders.
