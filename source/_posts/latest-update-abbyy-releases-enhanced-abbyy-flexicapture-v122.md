_The new version of the AI-powered intelligent capture platform with cloud delivery enables customers to start tomorrow._ 
  
ABBYY, a global provider of content intelligence solutions and services, today announced the launch of ABBYY FlexiCapture 12 Release 2\. The updated enterprise capture platform offers dramatically improved performance and higher processing speeds, continuous improvement through deeply integrated machine learning, and a brand new native cloud delivery channel. This allows any organization pursuing a digital transformation strategy to reduce processing costs, improve accuracy, accelerate time-to-revenue, and strengthen their position in the market.

ABBYY FlexiCapture is an intelligent platform for capturing meaningful data, relationships, and insights from documents, forms, and correspondence to improve business outcomes. FlexiCapture transforms documents into business value by capturing and validating information in any format at its point of need. By digitizing documents and automating document processes, FlexiCapture helps organizations remove risk and cost, accelerate revenue, and drive competitive advantage by automatically understanding content within documents and transforming it into meaningful insights. It is available both as a core enterprise capture platform and as a data capture component of robotic process automation (RPA) solutions.

The platform is perfectly suited for any enterprises or organizations implementing a digital transformation strategy. It solves the key pain points by capturing and understanding information to accelerate transactions, reduce costs, improve efficiencies, make better and faster decisions.

ABBYY FlexiCapture 12 R2 introduces a new delivery channel – FlexiCapture Cloud, a multitenant platform based on ABBYY FlexiCapture distributed application, which is hosted and managed by ABBYY on Microsoft Azure Cloud. It simplifies the consumption, deployment, and supportability of an enterprise capture solution and offers customers the most options in how they choose to deploy and consume intelligent capture.

With the new FlexiCapture, businesses and organizations also can substantially increase their processing volume and speed compared to the previous version of the software. The platform can be scaled both vertically and horizontally when deployed to support both high volume and fast document processing scenarios. Whether the customer needs to process more than 3 million documents in 24 hours or 2,000 pages a minute, FlexCapture’s architecture scales to meet the processing requirements. The user can control multi-server installations, distributed infrastructure, and operators via centralized configuration and management.

“FlexiCapture 12 Release 2 combines the high accuracy of self-learning intelligent capture technologies with accessibility and scalability provided by Microsoft Azure Cloud Services. At ABBYY, we aim to facilitate digital transformation delivering easy-to-integrate solutions for businesses, service providers, and software developers, so that they could achieve operational excellence, document flow visibility and ultimately better performance”, comments Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at ABBYY.

The AI-powered capture technology continuously improves providing for a faster, smoother workflow, while cutting labor and operating costs. The newly implemented machine learning techniques work in two ways: on the one hand, they ensure quick solution deployment, on the other, boost on-going performance while reducing the need for offline maintenance, system downtime, and costly professional services.

As always, ABBYY FlexiCapture 12 Release 2 comes with ready-to-use country-specific document profiles to jump-start the automation process and supports multiple input channels including email, paper, fax, e-documents, and mobile clients for iOS and Android to quickly process documents on the go.
