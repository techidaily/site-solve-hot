ABBYY launched its new global partner program, [ABBYYOne](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), to enable partners to accelerate Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) throughout the enterprise. IPA is a market category that research firm IDC estimates will grow an average of 20.1% over the next few years to reach $42.4 billion by 2025.\[1\] It converges artificial intelligence (AI) with automation to give enterprise leaders more control over business operations, and simpler ways to automate and improve processes and decision making. To help organizations navigate their intelligent automation journey, ABBYYOne connects the most diverse ecosystem of partners across the globe with ABBYY’s industry-leading [Intelligent Document Processing](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) (IDP) and [Process Intelligence](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) solutions.

“ABBYY is used by thousands of organizations worldwide, often through our partners who are specialists in particular industries, use cases or regions,” stated **Neil Murphy, Vice-President, Global Channel Chief** at ABBYY. “Our mission with the new ABBYYOne program is to build upon the existing success of our ecosystem by creating an aligned global partner strategy that delivers depth of focus to our committed partners.
