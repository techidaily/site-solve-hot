#### _Businesses can dramatically improve customer retention and accelerate digital transformation by engaging customers via their preferred channel._

  
ABBYY, a global leader in Content IQ technologies and solutions, today introduced ABBYY Mobile Capture, a software development kit (SDK) to enable end-to-end point-and-capture mobile experience where the user data is instantly captured via the camera to be used within an app or extracted and sent to back-end processes for self-service scenarios. The AI-enabled SDK frees the mobile user from manual data entry, which improves customer growth and retention for the business. It creates a completely new frictionless user experience for all onboarding and data entry scenarios like sign-up, registration, and document input, supports organizations’ digital transformation and robotic process automation (RPA) strategies.

The percentage of people who prefer mobile to other channels of [communication is growing generation to generation](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/). Businesses understand that they need to meet their customers where they are and engage with them in the most personalized way possible – this will determine their survival in a highly competitive digital transformation market landscape. However, when it comes to sectors like banking, insurance, logistics, and healthcare, mobile users still have to go through lengthy registration processes and manually type information from documents into apps, which is not only error prone and time consuming, but also one of the most disliked activities, according [a recent research study](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190319005321/en/Survey-Finds-Workers-Delegate-48-Tasks-Artificial "ABBYY survey") commissioned by ABBYY. From the business standpoint, the inability to automate data input not only slows down transactions but also creates inaccurate and unreliable onboarding processes and poor customer experiences, impedes transparency and operational visibility.

ABBYY Mobile Capture addresses all these pain points by providing enjoyable, barrier-free experience to the users of mobile applications in financial services, insurance, transportation and logistics, healthcare, and other industries. This way the SDK dramatically increases customer onboarding and retention rates, speeds up transactions, and improves customer loyalty.

“AI automation on mobile still is not being used by businesses to its full advantage,” comments Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at ABBYY. “This creates a massive opportunity for the early adopters of new-generation mobile technologies such as ABBYY Mobile Capture. The SDK benefits both organizations and end-users by making mobile interfaces more intuitive, boosting their ease and speed. It is designed for the workforce of the future who are driven by the culture of convenience, prefer mobile for admin tasks, and welcome smarter working practices”.

Mobile Capture allows the user to enter all the necessary information into an app by simply pointing their camera at the document or text. It combines ABBYY’s state-of-the-art mobile technologies enabling applications to automatically and in real time extract text and data from documents and objects and capture the best quality image for further back-end processing. It works for 63 languages on any background and includes out-of-the-box recognition of over 160 types of IDs, bank cards, MRZ, and IBAN.
