ABBYY’s vision is to be the leader in powering intelligent automation. This requires a very strong commitment to strategy execution, business plans, revenue growth, profitability, and other targets. But that only takes us so far. Our greatest advantage is our employees who turn ideas and plans into real achievements. By putting people first, we aim to be a great employer where people can grow professionally as well as personally.

Our Guiding Principles

Our commitment to excellence goes beyond our team values; it extends to the principles that guide our everyday actions and decisions. These principles are the compass that directs us towards achieving our goals while upholding the highest standards of integrity, collaboration, and customer-centricity

##### Think like a customer

We look for opportunities to delight our customers.

##### Do the right thing

We act like everyone is watching, doing the right thing for our company, our team, and our customers.

##### Be a team player

We don't sacrifice the team for the individual. Each of our successes, is the success of our team and vice versa. We are #oneABBYY.

##### Diversity & Inclusion

At ABBYY, we value and celebrate our differences and recognize the strength that diversity brings to the workplace. Our team is made up of 800+ colleagues worldwide, working from across 12 countries.

Together, we proudly represent 30+ nationalities, and we strive to create an environment where everyone feels welcome and supported.

##### Building a workforce that reflects the world

Our global team is comprised of 800+ people from 30+ nationalities, with ages ranging from 21 to 80.

##### Challenging the gender gap in the tech industry

At ABBYY, we are proud of our above-industry-average representation of women in the workplace. Women at ABBYY represent over 40% of our workforce, and more than a third of our team leaders.

##### Empowering our colleagues

Our colleagues are supported by our leadership team to form employee initiative groups to connect with, and represent, their community within the company. Women@ABBYY is an example of such community.

##### Flexibility for every lifestyle

We provide everyone at ABBYY with the option to work remotely or hybrid and build a work schedule that fits their lifestyle through our flexible hours policy. Additionally, as part of our Volunteer Time Off program, every ABBYY colleague can take two paid days off every year to contribute to a charity of their choice.

##### Nurturing inclusivity and integrity

We hold ourselves accountable to the highest level of integrity and ethical behavior enforced by our Code of Conduct, which sets the standards for how we act at ABBYY.

##### Celebrating our wins, while striving for better

Over the past years, we have consistently received above industry-average scores of 8.8/10 from our employees when asked how they would rank our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, through our monthly company-wide engagement surveys.

![DrawerImage-2](https://content.abbyy.com/-/media/project/abbyy/abbyy/company/careers/drawer-image-2.jpg?h=389&iar=0&w=750)

There is richness in variety of our collective experiences, history, backgrounds, abilities, and perspectives – those can all thrive within one community, even if that community is organized around a business purpose.

As most successful businesses, we strive to build our product in a way such that we can differentiate it and better serve our customers; in order to do that, we need to be able to innovate – innovation is a function of challenge and non-linear thinking, which is in turn enabled by individuals who represent different perspectives. To hire and retain diverse talent, we need to offer an inclusive environment – a community where differences are celebrated, and where we can all feel like we belong. That’s our aspiration and vision for ABBYY.
