## The New Normal: How Has the Quarantine Changed the Way You Work?

October 01, 2020

![](https://static2.abbyy.com/abbyycommedia/29478/1-productivity.jpg) 

During the quarantine, we conducted a global survey among 1600 users of ABBYY [FineScanner](https://go.onelink.me/0oMB/2b084a0a), ABBYY [Business Card Reader](https://go.onelink.me/LuYz/ca107d7), and ABBYY [TextGrabber](https://go.onelink.me/uny1/c9b5ef5c). We wanted to better understand the impact of the quarantine on the way people work.

We learned that 82.1% of respondents switched to a remote work setting during the COVID pandemic.

### Have you been more productive?

Our survey found that 43% of respondents noted they were more productive working from home than in an office, while 32.6% stated that they hadn’t noticed a difference in their level of productivity, and 21.8% claimed that they were less productive. Some respondents shared that they had mixed feeling about working from home.

_“Mixed - more productive some days, less productive other days”_

_“Some of each”_ 

### Have you been more motivated?

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Also, some of our users shared their advantages:

_“Being in the comfort of my home allows me to take a quick break and pet my cats or step outside for fresh air. Having windows open with sounds of nature. No fluorescent lights, no phones ringing, my music as loud as I want. Being able to prep dinner before 5\. Taking a nice walk during my lunch hour. These are a few of my favorite things!”_  
_“Less ineffective communication.”_  
_“More productive not wasting money on petrol and travel time and parking the car once I get to work”_  
_“Better food at home. Possibility to have conf calls while doing simple things around the house like watering plants or enjoying the comforts of my home.”_
